# AskMe_Web-Speech-API
This web app illustrates the use of web speech api to incorporate speech synthesis and speech recognition by developing the knowledge of the app.

The Web Speech API enables you to incorporate voice data into web apps. The Web Speech API has two parts: 

1)SpeechSynthesis (Text-to-Speech)

The SpeechSynthesis interface, a text-to-speech component allows programs to read out their text content (normally via the device's default speech synthesiser.) 

2)SpeechRecognition (Asynchronous Speech Recognition.)

SpeechRecognition interface provides the ability to recognize voice context from an audio input (normally via the device's default speech recognition service) and respond appropriately.

In this application on tapping the microphone when input is given via voice,the speech recognition interface recognizes it and displays the text on the text box.

If it has answer to that query asked, it responds via voice message with the help of speech synthesis.

This web app currently can answer questions like:
"What is the time"
"What is today's date"
"What is the weather in 'city-name'" 

For getting weather openweathermap API is used
